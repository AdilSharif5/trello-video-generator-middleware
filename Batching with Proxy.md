Remember bro Addu, Here there are two things, one considers all events and other filters.
After implementing this in the Vercel/middleware just directly trigger the GitHub Action, as all the batching and filtering is done in Cloudfare/proxy.


Implementing a proxy using Cloudflare Workers to batch events from Trello webhooks is a great approach. Below are the steps to create this setup, along with an example of how to implement batching over a specified time window (like 2-5 minutes).

### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Set Up Cloudflare Workers**:
   - Go to your [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select the appropriate domain.
   - Navigate to the "Workers" section and create a new worker.

2. **Write the Worker Code**:
   Below is an example of how you might set up a Cloudflare Worker to handle incoming webhook requests, batch them, and forward them to your Vercel endpoint every 2 minutes.

```javascript
let events = [];
let timeoutId = null;

// Set the batch interval (e.g., 2 minutes)
const BATCH_INTERVAL = 2 * 60 * 1000; // 2 minutes in milliseconds

async function handleBatch() {
  if (events.length === 0) return;

  // Send the batched events to your Vercel endpoint
  const response = await fetch('https://your-vercel-endpoint.com/api/trello-webhook', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ events }), // Send the batched events
  });

  if (!response.ok) {
    console.error('Failed to send batch:', response.statusText);
  }

  // Clear the events after sending
  events = [];
}

addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request));
});

async function handleRequest(request) {
  // Check if the request is a POST
  if (request.method !== 'POST') {
    return new Response('Method Not Allowed', { status: 405 });
  }

  const event = await request.json();

  // Add the event to the batch
  events.push(event);

  // Start the batch timer if not already started
  if (!timeoutId) {
    timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
      handleBatch();
      timeoutId = null; // Reset the timeoutId
    }, BATCH_INTERVAL);
  }

  // Respond immediately
  return new Response('Webhook received', { status: 200 });
}
```

### Key Components of the Code:

- **Event Collection**: The worker collects incoming events and pushes them to the `events` array.
- **Batch Timer**: A timeout (`timeoutId`) is set to handle the batching. It triggers the `handleBatch` function every 2 minutes if events are present.
- **Sending Batched Events**: When the timer expires, it sends the collected events to your Vercel endpoint.
- **Immediate Response**: The worker responds immediately to each incoming request, indicating that the webhook was received successfully.

### 3. **Deploy the Worker**:
   - After writing the code, save and deploy your Cloudflare Worker.
   - You’ll be given a URL for the Worker, which you’ll need to set as the webhook URL in Trello.

### 4. **Set the Webhook URL in Trello**:
   - Point your Trello webhook to the Cloudflare Worker URL instead of the Vercel URL.

### 5. **Test the Setup**:
   - Make changes in Trello to trigger the webhook and ensure that the events are being batched and sent to Vercel every 2 minutes.

### Additional Considerations:

- **Error Handling**: You might want to add more robust error handling and logging for production use, such as retry logic for failed requests.
- **Batch Size Limit**: Depending on the expected number of events, you may also want to implement a maximum batch size to avoid sending too many events at once.

By using Cloudflare Workers for this proxy setup, you can effectively manage webhook traffic from Trello and ensure that your Vercel function is called less frequently, helping to stay within your free plan limits.



Yes, you can definitely filter the incoming events based on specific criteria (like `idShort` values) before adding them to the `events` array. This way, you only collect the relevant events that you want to track, which helps optimize your usage and reduce unnecessary processing.

### Modifying the Worker Code

Here’s how you can modify the existing Cloudflare Worker code to only include events that meet certain conditions:

```javascript
let events = [];
let timeoutId = null;

// Set the batch interval (e.g., 2 minutes)
const BATCH_INTERVAL = 2 * 60 * 1000; // 2 minutes in milliseconds

// Define the relevant card IDs
const RELEVANT_CARD_IDS = [3, 4, 5, 6]; // Replace with your specific IDs

async function handleBatch() {
  if (events.length === 0) return;

  // Send the batched events to your Vercel endpoint
  const response = await fetch('https://your-vercel-endpoint.com/api/trello-webhook', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ events }), // Send the batched events
  });

  if (!response.ok) {
    console.error('Failed to send batch:', response.statusText);
  }

  // Clear the events after sending
  events = [];
}

addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request));
});

async function handleRequest(request) {
  // Check if the request is a POST
  if (request.method !== 'POST') {
    return new Response('Method Not Allowed', { status: 405 });
  }

  const event = await request.json();

  // Check if the event is relevant (e.g., contains `idShort`)
  if (event.action && event.action.data && event.action.data.card) {
    const cardIdShort = event.action.data.card.idShort;

    // Only add the event if the card ID is in the relevant array
    if (RELEVANT_CARD_IDS.includes(cardIdShort)) {
      events.push(event);
    }
  }

  // Start the batch timer if not already started
  if (!timeoutId) {
    timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
      handleBatch();
      timeoutId = null; // Reset the timeoutId
    }, BATCH_INTERVAL);
  }

  // Respond immediately
  return new Response('Webhook received', { status: 200 });
}
```

### Key Changes:

1. **Define Relevant Card IDs**: 
   - The `RELEVANT_CARD_IDS` array is defined to hold the `idShort` values of the cards you want to track.

2. **Check Each Event**: 
   - Before adding an event to the `events` array, the code checks if the incoming event contains the `idShort` of the card. If it does and it's in the `RELEVANT_CARD_IDS` array, the event is added.

### Benefits:

- **Reduced Noise**: By filtering out irrelevant events, you can significantly reduce the number of events that get processed, which is especially helpful when you're concerned about usage limits.
- **Optimized Processing**: Fewer events mean less processing overhead, making your system more efficient.

### Testing:

- Make sure to test your implementation by triggering events in Trello to ensure only the relevant events are being collected and sent to your Vercel endpoint. Adjust the filtering logic as needed based on your specific requirements.
